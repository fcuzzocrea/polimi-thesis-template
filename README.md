This template is the result of collecting a lot of resources about how to structure and write a thesis. 
The result is far from being the perfect template, but it should be a good starting point to simplify the tedious work of layout a thesis

## Template structure
The template is composed by several files. 
The idea is that each part of the thesis has a dedicated TeX file (introduction.tex, abstract.tex, …) that you can edit independently. 
thesis-main.tex is used to organize all the parts into a single document. 
Each chapter has its own folder to better organize the external resources that you may include (images, pdfs, …)

## What you have to modify in this template
This template does not have your personal information, in addition to the thesis's body you have to modify the title-page document with all your personal and thesis information rename the chapters and remove the ones that you do not use

## References
The layout of the thesis follows the guidelines indicated by Polimi's library (http://www.tedoc.polimi.it/uploads/media/PoliTesi_Istruzioni.pdf).
Guidelines for Abstract, Introduction and Conclusions are from a template written by Matteo Matteucci (http://airwiki.ws.dei.polimi.it/images/3/3c/SchemaTesi.tgz)
