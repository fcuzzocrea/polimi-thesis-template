I would like to thank Paolo for taking me as his first graduate student, and for his precious time that he spent for me in overviewing and correcting my work.\\
My heartfelt gratitude goes also to all the AOCS team members of D-Orbit, for the precious and essentials contributions they gave to this work, and for letting me better understand the value of autonomus work.\\
I would also like to thank my fellow comrades Jacopo and Ilaria, for their technical and moreover moral support during this long year I spent working on this project. Without them, I strongly believe I would never made it.\\
Thanks to my dad and my brother, who always supported me during these years of university. I think other people wouldn't gave me all the opportunities they gave me during these years.\\
I would expecially like to thank Flavio, a precious friend. People like you are rare to find, and I am more than sure that if if I hadn't met you
on my path, I would never have reached this goal. \\
And also thanks to Stefano and Davide for all the days passed in the library to study between one accademic break and another.
A special thanks goes also to Aureliano, Federico, Mattia, Umberto and Trevis for taking care of me during all those years passed at Politecnico di Milano.\\
Lastly but not leastly, thank you Cecilia for the love, the care and the understanding that you had for me in the past five years.
