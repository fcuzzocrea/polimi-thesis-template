First of all, I should thank my fellow comrades, Jacopo Guarneri and Ilaria Cannizzaro, for their technical and moreover moral support during this long journey I spent at D-Orbit, working on this project. Without them, withouth their support and their truely kind words for me, I strongly believe that I would never made it trought the end.\\
Thanks to my dad and my brother, who always supported me during these long years I spent in University. And also thanks for understanding my absence from home, during the long days I spent in the library to study for exams. I think other people wouldn't gave me all the opportunities they gave me during my life.\\
A truely heartfelt tanks goes to Flavio, a precious and invaluable friend. People like you are rare to find, and I am more than sure that if I hadn't met you on my path, I would never have reached this goal.\\
And also thanks to Stefano and Davide for all the days passed in the library to study between one "accademic break" and another.\\
A special thanks goes also to Aureliano, Federico, Mattia, Umberto and Trevis for taking care of me during the years passed at Politecnico di Milano.\\
Thanks to Alfonso and Benedetto for all the study done together during the master degree and for the mutual push to keep going trough our very rough exams.\\
Thanks also to professor Paolo Mantegazza for being such an inspiring person for me and for letting me understand what a true engineer is.\\
Lastly but not leastly, my gratitude is owed to Cecilia and her family who had to live with my frustration and doubts in the past years.\\
